# Product Requirements Document: Daily Task Management App

## Introduction/Overview

The Daily Task Management App is a modern, web-based todo list application designed to help users organize and track their daily tasks through a simple Kanban-style workflow. The application addresses the need for a straightforward, efficient task management tool that allows users to visualize their work progress through three distinct stages: Backlog, In Progress, and Done.

**Goal:** Create a simple, modern, and intuitive task management application that enables users to efficiently organize their daily tasks using a visual Kanban board interface.

## Goals

1. **Simplicity First:** Provide a clean, uncluttered interface that focuses on core task management functionality
2. **Visual Organization:** Enable users to easily visualize task progress through a three-column Kanban layout
3. **Persistent Storage:** Maintain task data between browser sessions using localStorage
4. **Modern UX:** Deliver a contemporary user experience with card-based design and drag-and-drop interactions
5. **Desktop Optimization:** Provide an optimal experience for desktop users without mobile complexity

## User Stories

1. **As a daily task manager**, I want to create new tasks with titles and descriptions so that I can capture all my work items in one place.

2. **As a productivity-focused user**, I want to drag and drop tasks between Backlog, In Progress, and Done columns so that I can easily update task status as work progresses.

3. **As someone who works across multiple browser sessions**, I want my tasks to persist when I close and reopen the application so that I don't lose my work.

4. **As a detail-oriented user**, I want to edit task titles and descriptions both inline and through a detailed modal so that I can quickly make small changes or comprehensive updates.

5. **As a careful user**, I want confirmation before deleting tasks or making major status changes so that I don't accidentally lose important work.

6. **As someone who tracks work history**, I want to see when tasks were created so that I can understand timing and workload patterns.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Task Management
1. The system must allow users to create new tasks with a required title (max 128 characters) and optional description (max 256 characters).
2. The system must display tasks in three distinct columns: Backlog, In Progress, and Done.
3. The system must allow users to drag and drop tasks between any of the three columns.
4. The system must allow users to reorder tasks within the same column via drag and drop.
5. The system must provide both inline editing (click to edit) and modal editing options for task titles and descriptions.
6. The system must allow users to delete tasks with confirmation prompts.
7. The system must display the creation date/time for each task.

### Data Persistence
8. The system must save all task data to browser localStorage automatically.
9. The system must load previously saved tasks when the application starts.
10. The system must persist task order and column positions between sessions.

### User Interface
11. The system must use a card-based design with clear borders and subtle shadows for task display.
12. The system must provide a modern, clean visual design optimized for desktop browsers.
13. The system must show simple toast notifications for errors and important actions.
14. The system must provide confirmation dialogs for delete operations and major task movements.

### Validation & Error Handling
15. The system must enforce the 128-character limit for task titles.
16. The system must enforce the 256-character limit for task descriptions.
17. The system must require a title before allowing task creation.
18. The system must handle localStorage errors gracefully with user notifications.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Mobile/Tablet Support:** The application is desktop-focused and does not need responsive mobile design.
2. **Multi-user Features:** No user accounts, sharing, or collaboration features.
3. **Advanced Filtering:** No search, filtering, or sorting capabilities beyond drag-and-drop reordering.
4. **Task Categories/Tags:** No categorization or tagging system.
5. **Due Dates/Reminders:** No time-based features or notifications.
6. **Task Limits:** No restrictions on the number of tasks per column.
7. **Complex Notifications:** No system notifications beyond simple toast messages.
8. **Data Export/Import:** No file-based data management features.
9. **Offline Functionality:** Beyond localStorage, no offline-first capabilities.
10. **Browser Compatibility:** Only modern browsers need to be supported.

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Layout:** Three-column layout with equal width columns
- **Cards:** Task cards with clear borders, subtle shadows, and rounded corners
- **Typography:** Clean, readable fonts with appropriate hierarchy
- **Colors:** Modern color palette with distinct but subtle column headers
- **Spacing:** Generous white space for clean appearance

### Interaction Design
- **Drag & Drop:** Smooth animations during task movement
- **Hover States:** Clear visual feedback on interactive elements
- **Modal Design:** Clean, centered modals for detailed task editing
- **Toast Notifications:** Non-intrusive, auto-dismissing messages

### Component Structure
- Header with application title and "Add Task" button
- Three-column main layout (Backlog | In Progress | Done)
- Task card component with inline editing capabilities
- Modal component for detailed task editing
- Toast notification component for system messages

## Technical Considerations

### Framework & Technology
- **Frontend:** Angular (latest stable version)
- **Storage:** Browser localStorage API
- **Drag & Drop:** Angular CDK drag-and-drop module
- **Styling:** Angular Material or custom CSS with modern design principles

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  status: 'backlog' | 'in-progress' | 'done';
  createdAt: Date;
  order: number;
}
```

### Key Components
- AppComponent (main shell)
- KanbanBoardComponent (three-column layout)
- TaskCardComponent (individual task display)
- TaskEditModalComponent (detailed editing)
- ToastService (notifications)

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement:** Users create and manage at least 5 tasks within their first session
2. **Session Persistence:** 90% of tasks are successfully restored when users return to the application
3. **Task Completion:** Users move at least 70% of created tasks to "Done" status
4. **User Experience:** Zero critical bugs related to drag-and-drop functionality
5. **Performance:** Application loads and becomes interactive within 2 seconds on standard desktop browsers

## Open Questions

1. **Color Scheme:** Should we implement a light/dark theme toggle, or stick with a single modern theme?
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Are basic keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Esc to cancel) needed for power users?
3. **Task Limits:** While no hard limits are specified, should we add soft warnings for very large task lists (e.g., 100+ tasks)?
4. **Browser Support:** Which specific browser versions should be the minimum supported (e.g., Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+)?
5. **Performance:** Should we implement virtual scrolling if users create hundreds of tasks?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic three-column layout
- Task creation with title/description
- Drag and drop between columns
- localStorage persistence

### Phase 2 (Enhanced UX)
- Inline and modal editing
- Creation timestamps
- Confirmation dialogs
- Toast notifications

### Phase 3 (Polish)
- Final visual design refinements
- Performance optimizations
- Edge case handling
- User experience improvements
