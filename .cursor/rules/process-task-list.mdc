# Task Management Protocol

## CRITICAL: One Sub-Task at a Time

- NEVER start the next sub-task without explicit user permission
- After completing ANY sub-task, IMMEDIATELY stop and ask: "Task X.Y complete. May I proceed with X.Z?"
- Wait for user confirmation ("y", "yes", or explicit instruction) before continuing
- If user says anything other than clear approval, stop and await further direction

## Sub-Task Completion Protocol

1. Mark completed sub-task as `[x]` in task file
2. Update "Relevant Files" section with any changes
3. Ask user for permission to continue
4. STOP and wait for response

## Parent Task Completion Protocol

When ALL sub-tasks under a parent are complete:

1. Run full test suite if available
2. Stage changes: `git add .`
3. Clean up temporary files
4. Commit with conventional format:

   ```sh
   git commit -m "feat: [parent task summary]" -m "- [key changes]" -m "- [additions]" -m "Related to [task#]"
   ```

5. Mark parent task as `[x]`

## Forbidden Actions

- NEVER work on multiple sub-tasks in sequence without permission
- NEVER assume user wants to continue to next task
- NEVER batch multiple sub-tasks together
- NEVER proceed if user gives unclear or ambiguous response

## Required Responses

Always end sub-task completion with:
"âœ… Task X.Y completed: [brief description]

May I proceed with Task X.Z: [next task description]?"

## Emergency Stop

If user says "stop", "wait", "pause", or shows any hesitation, immediately halt all work and await clarification.
